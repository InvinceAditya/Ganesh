            With great joy and devotion, people of all age groups participate in the festival. Be it in pandals, temples or homes, Ganesha Chaturthi is observed with immense happiness. People sing, dance, and light up fireworks. With the beautiful chant of mantras, aarti, flowers, Ganesha is worshipped to bid farewell.
            <br><br><br>
            Ganesha is very fond of sweet-smelling scents, sweet treats, and more. He is warmhearted. For worshiping him well, you should prepare sweets (laddus) to offer him. Further, arrange some flowers and decorate the place with sweet-smelling fragrances.
            <br><br>
            The favourite colours of Lord Ganesha are green and yellow. This is why Lord Ganesha loves the marigold flowers because of the pure yellow colour that these flowers have. All of Ganesha's favourite things must be offered to him during Ganesh Chaturthi whenever he is worshipped by his devotees.
            <BR><BR>
            Modaks
Modaks are Lord Ganesha's favourite foods so much so that he is also known as 'Modapriya'. There are several stories that mention his love for the sweet dumplings. Made with rice flour, coconut, jaggery and steamed to perfection, devotees prepare several types of Modak and offer them as a prasad.
